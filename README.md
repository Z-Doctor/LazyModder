# LazyModder
LazyModder is a library developed with the purpose of making a modder's life easier. It handles many of the repetitive tasks asked upon the modder without limiting what the modder can do.

# How to contribute
With some input from Choonster, I have added a gradle to the git. So if you want to contribute, or just setup the library in your workspace, simply import the git as a general project. Then right click the project >> configure >> Add Gradle Nature.

This will import forge and set up the workspace.

# How to use the library
With some more input from Choonster, I will now detail how to use the library. First get the library version you want, see <a href="#howtobuild">How to Build</a>
