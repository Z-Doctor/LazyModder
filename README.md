# LazyModder
Is it an api? Well I don't think so? Basically it has a bunch of automatated functions. It just makes life (as a modder) easier. I plan to (probably) better document this if I have time and people like it, but basically there are a bunch of classes that create practically anything Minecraft (items, block, food, weapons, tools, armor, etc). And the great thing is that they take care of registering themself and handling their rendering. My project <a href="https://github.com/Z-Doctor/BloodBaubles">Blood Baubles</a> is a good example.
